    This function calculates the exponent and mantissa from a desired value. Can e.g. be used for weights.
    If used for weights: Please use calculate_effective_weight to calculate
     the effective weight also taking into account the precision.

    Important: This is based on a very simple idea to maximize the precision.
     However, it does not replace manual checking of your weights
     (E.g. instead of letting them go from 0-300, you should restrict them to 0-255,
     as you will loose precision otherwise)

    Also, be careful when using this with plastic weights.
    Otherwise your range might be limited to the initial weight range.

    the given exponent bounds [-8, 7] are the default for weights on loihi

    Note that the negative exponent bound will be overwritten if it is too low. It should not be lower
    than 8 - precision, as the final result (weight * 2**exponent) still has to be integer for integration
    on the membrane potential. I.e. lower weight exponents than 8-precision are useless (and have the potential
    to be misinterpreted).

    :param value: the value for which you want to calculate mantissa and exponent
    :param precision: the allowed precision in bits for the mantissa (this actually needs to be 8 for synapses
        independent of the weight precision, as the value always goes to 255)
    :param name: just for printing
    :param exponent_bounds: bounds of the exponent. E.g. on Loihi, the weight exponent can range from -8 to +7
